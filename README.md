# RouteDecoder

Discount pdf scalper that gets the ERSA approved routes from AsA, since they are too lazy to make their own api...

Oh yeah it requires java 8+ and Python 3.8+ to be installed.

Dependencies:
- tabula-py
- PyPDF2
- requests

if posting to the routes api which is in development, chuck the base url in a .env file.
